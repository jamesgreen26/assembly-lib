/**
 * Lets <i>any</i> menu-backed block open its GUI while riding a assembly, with no per-block or
 * per-menu patching — purely client-side.
 *
 * <p><b>The problem.</b> A block used on a assembly runs its vanilla {@code useWithoutItem}
 * against the {@link AssemblySimServerLevel}, so the {@link BlockPos} it hands to
 * {@code openMenu} is the assembly-LOCAL position. The standard menu-open round-trip writes that
 * local pos to the client, whose menu factory then resolves the backing block entity via the
 * near-universal {@code level.getBlockEntity(pos)} pattern — but against the REAL client level,
 * where nothing exists at the local pos — and throws.
 *
 * <p><b>The fix.</b> When the client sends a assembly "use" packet it records the targeted
 * {motor, localPos} here ({@link #beginUse}). While a menu is being constructed from server data —
 * bracketed by a mixin around {@code MenuType.create} via {@link #beginConstruction}/
 * {@link #endConstruction} — a mixin on {@code Level#getBlockEntity} consults {@link #resolve}: a
 * lookup at the recorded local pos is redirected to the live client-side block entity taken from the
 * host motor's {@link AssemblyRenderState}. The menu only needs <i>a</i> block entity to back its
 * slots/{@code ContainerData}; the actual contents arrive through normal menu sync, exactly as for a
 * world block.
 *
 * <p>All state is touched only on the client main thread (use-packet send and menu construction both
 * run there); the {@code Level#getBlockEntity} mixin additionally guards on {@code isClientSide} so
 * the integrated server's lookups are never redirected.
